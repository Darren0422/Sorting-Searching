# Sorting-Searching
## Description 

This is a Java application is used to implement, test, and understand fundamental searching and sorting algorithms.

## Importance 

This repository is important as it shows my understanding and comprehension of Java, sorting techniques (used to sort data held in data structures) and searching techniques (used to search datasets).
It displays my familiarity and proficiency with algorithms (linear search, insertion sort, and bubble sort). It provides insights into the efficiency of algorithms, in terms of time complexity. 
The repository also discusses the real-world application of binary search in scenarios like searching large databases or file systems.

## Application BubbleSort

A basic implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an ArrayList of strings in ascending order which prints both the original and sorted lists.

### Bubble Sort Implementation:

The application includes a method called "bubbleSort" that performs the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an ArrayList<String>.
It uses nested loops to iterate through the elements of the ArrayList and compare elements.
If the left element is greater than the right element, their positions are swapped.
This process is repeated until the ArrayList is sorted alphabetically in ascending order.

## Application Sort&Search

A basic implementation of linear search, binary search and insertion sort, along with a demonstration of their usage on an array of integers.

### Linear Search Implementation:

The application includes a method called "linearSearch" that performs a linear search on an array to find a specific item.
It uses a loop to iterate through each element in the array and returns the index of the first occurrence of the searched item.

### Insertion Sort Implementation:

The application includes an insertionSort method that sorts an array of integers using the Insertion Sort algorithm.
It iterates through the unsorted part of the array, compares the elements and shifts them to insert the current element in the correct position.

### Binary Search Usage:

The application demonstrates the use of binary search on a sorted array using Arrays.binarySearch.
