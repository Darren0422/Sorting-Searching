/*
 * Which searching algorithm would be appropriate to use on the given list?
 * - Linear search
 * 
 * Explain why you think this algorithm was a good choice.
 * - The array of integers are not in order so a linear search is appropriate .
 * 
 * Implement the searching algorithm you havenâ€™t tried yet in this Task on the sorted array to find the number 9. Add a comment to explain where you would use this algorithm in the real world.
 * - Binary search is used on sorted lists to speed up the search. This search method is used in in the real world through searching large databases or as part of a file system.
